this is my custom build State management library integrated with the working counter app

State folder contains the MAIN CODE FOR THE STATE MANAGEMENT ENGiNE TO WORK

AppState holds the providers mapping, to be done by user

Rest is providers and UI 

Detailed Readme file would be released on Pub.dev after the proper evaluation.
